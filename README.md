# WhatsApp-Chat-Message-Counter
This is to address one of the few problems caused by the new updates in WhatsApp. This specific application aims to count the messages in a WhatsApp Chat.

I have designed this to run with any text file that contains the chat history from WhatsApp. Make sure to use it with a terminal. I normally like to include sample text files to test the output, but I decided to refrain from doing so, as I was not given consent. Moreover, it is human decency to respect privacy and boundaries.
