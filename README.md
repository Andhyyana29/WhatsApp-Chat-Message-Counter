# WhatsApp-Chat-Message-Counter
This is to address one of the few problems caused by the new updates in WhatsApp. This specific application aims to count the messages in a WhatsApp Chat.

I have designed this to run with any text file that contains the chat history from WhatsApp. Make sure to use it with a terminal. I normally like to include sample text files to test the output, but I decided to refrain from doing so, as I was not given consent. Moreover, it is basic human decency to respect privacy and boundaries. 

# EDIT
I have added a feature which counts the messages sent by an individual in a chat/group.

To use this app:
1. Go to the WhatsApp chat you wish to count the messages in. 
2. Export the chat as a .txt file and save it in the same directory as this program.
3. Configure the primt statements as you like to.
4. Run it!
